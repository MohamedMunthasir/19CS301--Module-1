Exp.No:1(a)	PYTHON BASICS-PRINTING MULTILINE STRING

### AIM
To create a python program to print the string in multiline using triple quotes.
### ALGORITHM

Step 1:	 Begin the program.

Step 2:	 Use triple quotes (''' or """) to define a string that spans multiple lines.

Step 3:	 Use the print() function to display the multi-line string.

Step 4:	 Terminate the program

### PROGRAM
```string_single_quotes = '''I am a string literal
... has more than one
... line
....placed inside triple single quotes'''


string_double_quotes = """I am a string literal
... has more than one
... line
....placed inside triple double quotes"""


print(string_single_quotes)
print(string_double_quotes)
```
### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus the python program for printing multiline strings has been implemented and executed successfully.

Exp.No:1(b)	DATA TYPES-PYTHON PROGRAM TO PRINTING INTEGER LITERALS

### AIM
To write a python program to print the following integer literals 123,456,789
### ALGORITHM
Step 1:	Begin the program.

Step 2:	Initialize the integer literals 123, 456, and 789.

Step 3:	Use the print() function to display the numbers 123, 456, and 789.

Step 4:	Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM
```
num1 = 123
num2 = 456
num3 = 789
print(num1)
print(num2)
print(num3)
```
### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus the python program for printing the Integer Literals has been implemented and executed successfully.






Exp.No:1(c)	VARIABLES AND EXPRESSIONS, OPERATORS ADDING TWO COMPLEX NUMBERS

### AIM
To write a python program for adding two complex numbers, get the user input using the eval() function.
### ALGORITHM
Step 1:	Begin the program.

Step 2:	Use eval() to get two complex numbers as input from the user.

Step 3:	Print the complex numbers entered by the user.

Step 4:	Perform the addition of the two complex numbers using + operator.

Step 5:	Print the sum of the two complex numbers.

Step 6:	Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM
```
A = eval(input())
B = eval(input())

sum_complex = A + B

print(sum_complex)
```
### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus the python program for  adding two complex numbers has been implemented and executed successfully.


Exp.No:1(d)	CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS- CHECKING ODD OR EVEN

### AIM
To Write a  python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if..else statement
### ALGORITHM
Step 1:	 Begin the program.

Step 2:	 Take a character input from the user

Step 3:	 If a % 2 == 0 (i.e., a is divisible by 2) Print "EVEN"

Step 4:	 Otherwise, display "ODD"

Step 5:	 Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM
```
a=int(input())
if(a%2==0):
    print("EVEN")
else:
    print("ODD")
```
### OUTPUT 
![image](https://github.com/23013357/19CS301--Module-1/blob/main/EE.png)


### RESULT
Thus the python program to check whether the input is odd or even using if..else statement  has been implemented and executed successfully.





Exp.No:1(e)	SEB- CHECK TWO INTEGERS ARE EQUAL.

### AIM
To write a python program to check whether the two integer numbers are equal using conditional Expression(Ternary).
### ALGORITHM

Step 1:	Begin the program.

Step 2:	Read the first number and store it in variable a.

Step 3:	Read the second number and store it in variable b.

Step 4:	Compare the two numbers,If a is equal to b, then display "True".

Step 5: Otherwise, display "False".

Step 6:	Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM
```
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
if a==b:
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")
```
### OUTPUT
![image](https://github.com/23013357/19CS301--Module-1/blob/main/rr.png)

 
### RESULT
Thus the python program to check whether the two integer numbers are equal using conditional Expression(Ternary). has been implemented and executed successfully.
